## ABSTRACT
When we travel within the Beninese territory, an binary choice comes to us for housing : staying with family or in a hotel. This low offer penalizes many travelers. Staying with family is not always easy, staying in a hotel is expensive and not very friendly. On the other hand, many individuals have vacant dwellings and wish they could make a steady gain while also having the opportunity to dispose of them at the right time. Moreover, without this being the primary purpose of his trip, any traveler wishes to make his stay a unique experience. He therefore chooses his destination according to the different cultural attractions or the particular experiences that it offers. This end-of-study dissertation proposes to offer an online tool to put two private individuals in direct contact : a local host and a traveler in search of a reasonably priced, comfortable accommodation or a unique experience. Thus, the establishment of a community platform for discovery of thematic experience and short-term rental of apartments or portions of apartments between individuals, implemented with the modern JavaScript software stack : NodeJs, NPM, React, Webpack , Babel, Ionic will be profitable to meet the expectations of various customers. This will allow travelers to book accommodation or register for a thematic experience ; On the other hand, guests can rent an apartment or offer an experience.
